\# Git \& GitHub Guide for First-Time Contributors



Welcome! This guide walks you through the full contribution workflow: clone → branch → commit → push → pull request → review updates → resolving conflicts → squash merge. Steps are given both via the \*\*command line\*\* and \*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*.



\---



\## 1. Clone the repository



Cloning downloads a full copy of the repo, including its history, to your machine.



\*\*Command line\*\*

```bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-github-name>/CAREC-Project.git

cd CAREC-Project

```



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. Click \*\*File → Clone Repository\*\*.

2\. Select the repo from the list (or paste the URL under the "URL" tab).

3\. Choose a local folder and click \*\*Clone\*\*.



\---



\## 2. Create a branch



Never commit directly to `main`. Create a new branch for each piece of work.



\### Branch naming convention



This project (CAREC) uses the pattern:



```

docs/<issue-number>-<your-github-name>

```



For example, this guide's own branch is named `docs/19-Sanjanabarge` (issue #19, contributor `Sanjanabarge`). Use the same pattern for other workstreams — swap the `docs/` prefix for the relevant area if your issue calls for it (e.g. `scenario/`, `tooling/`), but always keep `<issue-number>-<your-github-name>` after it.



\*\*Command line\*\*

```bash

git checkout -b docs/<issue-number>-<your-github-name>

```



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. Click the \*\*Current Branch\*\* dropdown.

2\. Click \*\*New Branch\*\*.

3\. Enter the branch name as `docs/<issue-number>-<your-github-name>` and click \*\*Create Branch\*\*.



\---



\## 3. Make changes and commit



Commit small, logical chunks of work with clear messages.



\*\*Command line\*\*

```bash

git add <file-or-folder>       # or: git add .

git commit -m "Short, clear summary of the change"

```



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. Your edited files appear automatically in the \*\*Changes\*\* tab.

2\. Check the boxes next to the files you want to include.

3\. Enter a summary (and optional description) at the bottom left.

4\. Click \*\*Commit to <branch-name>\*\*.



\*\*Good commit message tips\*\*

\- Use the imperative mood: "Add guide" not "Added guide."

\- Keep the summary under \~50 characters; use the description field for details.

\- One logical change per commit — don't mix unrelated edits.



\---



\## 4. Push your branch



Pushing uploads your local commits to GitHub.



\*\*Command line\*\*

```bash

git push -u origin <branch-name>

```

(After the first push, `git push` alone is enough.)



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. Click \*\*Push origin\*\* in the top toolbar.

2\. The first push will prompt to also \*\*publish the branch\*\* — confirm.



\---



\## 5. Open a pull request (PR)



\*\*Command line / browser\*\*

1\. Go to the repo on GitHub — you'll usually see a banner: \*\*"Compare \& pull request."\*\* Click it.

2\. If not, go to \*\*Pull requests → New pull request\*\*, choose `main` as base and your branch as compare.

3\. Fill in a title and description (what changed and why; link the issue, e.g. `Closes #19`).

4\. Click \*\*Create pull request\*\*.



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. Click \*\*Branch → Create Pull Request\*\*, or the \*\*Create Pull Request\*\* button after pushing.

2\. This opens your browser with the PR form pre-filled — complete and submit it there.



\---



\## 6. Update your PR after a review



Reviewers often ask for changes. You keep working on the \*\*same branch\*\* — new commits automatically appear on the open PR.



\*\*Command line\*\*

```bash

\# make the requested edits, then:

git add <changed-files>

git commit -m "Address review feedback: <what changed>"

git push

```



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. Make your edits.

2\. Commit them (Step 3) and push (Step 4) as before — no new PR needed.



Reply to review comments on GitHub, and click \*\*Resolve conversation\*\* once addressed.



\---



\## 7. Resolving conflicts (safely, without destructive commands)



A conflict happens when `main` and your branch changed the same lines. Here's how to fix it without losing work.



\*\*Command line\*\*

```bash

git checkout main

git pull                     # get the latest main

git checkout <branch-name>

git merge main                # bring main's changes into your branch

```

Git will mark conflicts in the affected files like this:

```

<<<<<<< HEAD

your version

=======

incoming version from main

>>>>>>> main

```

1\. Open each conflicted file and edit it to the correct final content (remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers).

2\. Save the file, then:

```bash

git add <resolved-file>

git commit               # completes the merge

git push

```



\*\*GitHub Desktop\*\*

1\. GitHub Desktop will flag conflicted files after a \*\*Branch → Update from main\*\*.

2\. Click \*\*Open in \[your editor]\*\* next to each conflicted file, resolve it the same way as above, and save.

3\. Back in GitHub Desktop, mark the file as resolved and click \*\*Continue Merge\*\*, then \*\*Push origin\*\*.



\*\*If you get stuck:\*\* you can always abort a merge that's gone wrong and start over — this is non-destructive to your existing commits:

```bash

git merge --abort

```

Ask a maintainer for help if a conflict looks confusing. Avoid `git reset --hard` or force-pushing unless a maintainer specifically tells you to — those can discard work.



\---



\## 8. Squash merge (done by a maintainer)



Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will usually \*\*squash and merge\*\* it — combining all your commits into a single, clean commit on `main`.



\- On the PR page, they'll click the dropdown next to \*\*Merge pull request\*\* and choose \*\*Squash and merge\*\*.

\- You don't need to do anything extra — just make sure your branch is up to date and all conversations are resolved.

\- After merging, you can delete your branch (GitHub will offer a \*\*Delete branch\*\* button, or delete it locally with `git branch -d <branch-name>`).

\## Quick reference



| Step | Command line | GitHub Desktop |

|---|---|---|

| Clone | `git clone <url>` | File → Clone Repository |

| Branch | `git checkout -b docs/<issue-number>-<github-name>` | Current Branch → New Branch |

| Commit | `git add . \&\& git commit -m "..."` | Check files → write summary → Commit |

| Push | `git push -u origin <name>` | Push origin |

| PR | Open via GitHub banner | Branch → Create Pull Request |

| Update PR | commit + push again | commit + push again |

| Conflicts | `git merge main`, edit, `git add`, `git commit` | Update from main → resolve in editor → Continue Merge |

| Merge | (maintainer) Squash and merge | (maintainer) Squash and merge |
